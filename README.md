Project Inputs Automation
<h3>emailAutomationAppscript is V-0 </h3> where i achieve frame work to extracr & store attachement as desired location automatically.
But is fails to remane file as requred and Email content is not as per required as it was missing some points Formating of email in plain body when i tried to save as it to word .docx

<h3> EmailAutomation&FolderStrure V-1</h3> resolve above issue of having email by solution of storing as .html file to have all formating intact. Also issue of saving same attachement file whenever script runs is also solved here
